	"""this class solves two problems with multithreaded 
	programs in Python, (1) a signal might be delivered 
	to any thread (which is just a malfeature) and (2) if 
	the thread that gets the signal is waiting, the signal 
	is ignored (which is a bug). 
					  
	The watcher is a concurrent process (not thread) that 
	waits for a signal and the process that contains the 
	threads.  See Appendix A of The Little Book of Semaphores.

	I have only tested this on Linux.  I would expect it to 
	work on the Macintosh and not work on Windows.
